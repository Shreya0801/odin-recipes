    <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish made of spicy chickpeas (chole) served with deep-fried fluffy bread (bhature). 
       It's a beloved street food and comfort meal, especially enjoyed for breakfast or lunch.</p>

    <p>The chole is cooked with onions, tomatoes, and aromatic Indian spices to create a rich and flavorful curry. 
       The bhature, made from fermented dough, is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, making it a perfect pairing with the spicy chickpeas. 
       This hearty dish is often accompanied by sliced onions, pickles, and a glass of lassi.</p>
