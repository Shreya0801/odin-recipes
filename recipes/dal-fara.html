    <h2>Steps for Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make fara, take a pan and add 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons ghee, and ½ tablespoon salt. Bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiled, remove it from heat and add rice flour to the water. Mix well and cover it for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Soak chana dal (split chickpeas) and urad dal (split black gram) overnight or for 4-5 hours. Drain the water and grind them coarsely.</li>
        <li>To the ground dal mixture, add chopped green chillies, ginger paste, red chilli powder, turmeric, coriander powder, fresh coriander leaves, and salt. Mix well — this is the stuffing for the fara.</li>
        <li>Now, knead the rice dough with a little ghee to make it smooth. Add a little water if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll them out like a small poori (flat circle). If the edges crack, cut them neatly with a round lid or bowl.</li>
        <li>Place some dal stuffing in the center and fold the circle in half. Seal the edges by pressing gently.</li>
        <li>Prepare all fara this way. Boil water in a deep pan and place the fara in a steamer above the boiling water. Cover and steam on low flame until cooked.</li>
        <li>Once ready, serve the steamed fara with chutney, or slice them and sauté in ghee with cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and green chillies for added flavor.</li>
    </ol>
